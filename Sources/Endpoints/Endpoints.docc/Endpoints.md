# ``Endpoints``

Endpoints is a small library for creating statically and strongly-typed definitions of endpoints with paths, methods, inputs and outputs.

## Overview

The purpose of Endpoints is to, in a type-safe way, define how to create a `URLRequest` from typed properties and, additionally, define how a response for the request should be handled. The library not only includes the ability to create these requests in a type-safe way, but also includes helpers to perform the requests using `URLSession`. Endpoints does not try to wrap the URL loading system to provide features on top of it like Alamofire. Instead, Endpoints focuses on defining endpoints and associated data to produce a request as a URLRequest object to be plugged into vanilla `URLSession`s. However, this library could be used in conjunction with Alamofire if desired.
